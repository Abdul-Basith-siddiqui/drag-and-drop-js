drag-and-drop-js
The implemented drag and drop functionality allows users to drag items from one container and drop them into another. It provides visual feedback during dragging and displays a success message when an item is dropped. A reset button is available to clear the drop container and move the items back to the original container. The solution is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without relying on any third-party libraries or frameworks. It follows best practices for clean code, responsiveness, usability, and accessibility.
